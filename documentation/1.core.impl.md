Implementation of the core functionalities of RDZNL
===================================================

List of the models, views, templates and script files that implements the core functionalities of [RDNZL](https://play.spotify.com/track/7CwrHTP65cBnNkeiNBcPvN).

Models
------
The program's main logic is articulate on those classes :

```
Feature[Abstract]
-----------------
id = SlugField()
getMainRepresentation() [Abstract]
title = CharField()
description = TextField()
employer = ForeignKey(Employer)

Link[Abstract]
--------------
feature = ForeignKey(Feature)
explanation = TextField()
getRepresentation()
getExplanationRepresentation() [Abstract]

Hashtag
-------
id = SlugField()
name = CharField()
features = ManyToMany(Link)

Employer
--------
id = SlugField()
name = CharField()
description = TextField(required=False)
website = URLField()
logo = ImageField(upload_to="/logos/", required=False)
recommendation = ForeignKey(Recommendation, required=False)
getRepresentation()

Recommendation
--------------
author_name = CharField()
author_email = EmailField()
body = TextField()
```

*For now, I don't see any reason to separate the model of Feature and Link from their representation. 
I will if various representation are made possible.*

*The id are ```SlugFields``` instead of the classical integers, because they will be used in the URL. And ```/python/cv``` is sweeter than ```/1/2```*

Features and Links must support french and english, thanks to ```django-modeltranslation```

Templates and scripts
---------------------

The following sections are the project's template 
along with the scripts that have to be written for them.

### The Main Template
It is the only full page, sent whenever the website is loaded in a browser. 
*States* :
- Main page state : the grid of all the hashtags 
- Open hashtag state : a hashtag is open, its name, one of its feature and a next button are displayed

*Scripts* :
- The logic to open and close hashtags (switching from a state to another)
- The logic of an open hashtag : 
```
When the hastag is first opened : Loads, from the server, the first feature linked to itself
When "next" it pressed : Loads, from the server, the next feature linked to itself
```
- Hooks to load it in any state, and to load with one specific couple of hashtag and feature. 
*Careful, when loading the page in Main page state, the hashtag presentation must be opened.*
- Moving through states should modify the URL

### The HTML representation of the Explanation and Feature

The classes Text Feature and TextLink use them to generate their representation.

### The HTML representation of the Employers

The classes Employer use it to generate its only representation

*States* :
- Collapsed : Only the name and logo are shown
              Also a button to switch to the uncollapsed mode, if and only if,
              element in the uncollapsed section are in the system
- Open : Collapsed + Description and recommendation

*Script*:
- The logic to toggle between states

Views
-----
These functions are useful to several views

### maintemplate_loader
```args: hasetagopened, featureopened```
This function sends back a rendered version of The Main Template.
It can open it in its two states : 
- If hashtagopened is provided, it's in the Open hashtag state
- If both hasetagopened and featureopened are provided : It's in the Open hashtag state
set with the feature
- Else : it's in Main page state

- - -

The following section are the different views,
Their behavior and tied URL.

### mainpage
```URL : /```
Execute ```maintemplate_loader``` to return the main template in Main page state

### hashtag
```URL : /<hashtag_name>/```
This view has two behavior:
If is requested via Ajax, it will simply send back the number of its first linked feature.
Otherwise, it will execute maintemplate_loader to return the website in Open hashtag state

### feature
```URL : /<hashtag_id>/<feature_id>```
This view has two behavior:
If is requested via Ajax, it will simply :
- send back the body of the feature linked to the hashtag
- And either :
    - the number of the next feature linked to the hashtag
    - if there's no next feature, it sends back : ```NONE```

Otherwise, it will execute maintemplate_loader to return the website in Open hashtag state, with the feature on
